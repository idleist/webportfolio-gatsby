###project outline
My brother recently completed his first novel. He asked if I could design a web site for him to advertise his work. He had three simple requests, to show the artwork and design from the novel, to display some information about himself and the work, and to include a link to where customers could purchase the novel.

I had recently been working with React and thought that this would be a great project to build with GatsbyJS. GatsbyJS lends itself to this kind of static site. I used graphql with gatsby-image to optimize the images on the site.

I also love working with Inkscape and creating SVG backgrounds for my web pages. I added a savannah svg nackdrop to the about section. The page is fully responsive, as he wanted the site to look good on mobile devices. He was very pleased with the result. I think the page is striking and does what it was designed to do.
